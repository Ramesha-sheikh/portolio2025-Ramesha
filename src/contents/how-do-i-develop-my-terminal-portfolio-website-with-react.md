## Intro

When I first started learning **HTML and CSS**, I never imagined that one day I would be building **AI-powered applications**. My journey into web development has been full of experiments, mistakes, and lots of learning — but every step taught me something valuable. In this blog, I want to share how I went from writing simple `<div>` tags to exploring **Next.js, n8n automations, and AI agents**.

## The Early Days: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Like most developers, my journey began with the basics — HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Soon after, I discovered JavaScript, which brought life to my projects with interactivity. At this stage, my focus was mostly on **front-end fundamentals**.

---

## Learning TypeScript and React

Once I felt confident with JavaScript, I moved on to **TypeScript**. Strong typing helped me write more reliable code and understand larger projects better.  
At the same time, I started using **ReactJS**, which opened the door to modern component-based development. It was a big shift from plain JavaScript, but it made building applications much easier.

---

## Exploring Next.js

Next.js became my next stop. With features like server-side rendering and routing, it allowed me to create **scalable projects and portfolios**. I even built my own portfolio website using Next.js, which later became the foundation for experimenting with more advanced ideas.

---

## Stepping into Automations: n8n

At some point, I realized development isn’t just about writing code — it’s also about **automating workflows**. Tools like **n8n** helped me connect APIs, streamline tasks, and experiment with no-code + code hybrid solutions. It gave me a whole new perspective on how powerful automation can be in real-world projects.

## The Future: AI and Agentic Development

Recently, I’ve been diving into **AI-powered apps and agents**. Using the OpenAI SDK and integrating them into Next.js projects, I’m now exploring how websites can be more **intelligent and interactive**. From chatbots to AI agents that perform tasks, this field feels both exciting and limitless.

## Outro

Looking back, it’s amazing to see the path from writing simple HTML pages to working with **Next.js, n8n, and AI agents**. This journey has taught me that learning is never linear — every new step builds on the last. And the best part? I’m just getting started.

If you’re also beginning your journey, remember: **start small, stay consistent, and never stop experimenting.**
