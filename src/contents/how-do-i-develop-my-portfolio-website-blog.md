title: Building Intelligent Agents with OpenAI SDK and Gemini
description: My journey of experimenting with OpenAI SDK and Gemini to build multiple custom AI agents for real-world use cases.
excerpt:
  I explored the power of OpenAI SDK and Gemini by building agents like Plant Care Assistant,
  Teacher Agent, Crypto Advisor, Shopping Helper, Pregnancy Guide, Document Agent,
  and even a Medical Imaging Diagnosis prototype. In this blog, I share my experience,
  challenges, and future ideas.

## Why I Started with OpenAI SDK

I’ve always been interested in creating intelligent applications that go beyond static websites or simple automation.  
When I discovered the **OpenAI SDK** and experimented with **Gemini’s agent features**, I realized I could design specialized agents for very practical use cases.

This blog is about how I combined creativity, AI, and coding to make different kinds of agents — some for learning, some for productivity, and some just for curiosity!

## Agents I Built

Here are some of the custom agents I experimented with:

- 🌱 **Plant Care Agent** – Gives plant care tips (watering schedule, sunlight needs, soil suggestions).  
- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher Agent** – Acts like a study assistant, explaining concepts simply and giving examples.  
- 📄 **Document Agent** – Helps summarize long documents and extract key insights quickly.  
- 💰 **Crypto Agent** – Fetches real-time crypto updates and gives market insights.  
- 🛍️ **Shopping Agent** – Recommends products and compares features/prices.  
- 🤰 **Pregnancy Guide Agent** – Provides health-related guidance and safe lifestyle tips.  
- 🏥 **Medical Imaging Diagnosis Agent (Prototype)** – Explored the idea of using AI to analyze medical imaging reports (not for real clinical use yet, but as a learning experiment).  

Each agent was powered by **OpenAI SDK** for reasoning and natural language generation. For some, I tested Gemini for advanced context handling and faster response generation.

## Tech Stack

- **Core AI**: OpenAI SDK (with GPT models)  
- **Extra AI Testing**: Gemini Agents  
- **Frontend**: Next.js (for simple UIs)  
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS  
- **Integration**: API calls for data (e.g., crypto prices, shopping APIs)  

---

## Challenges I Faced

- Designing structured prompts that worked consistently.  
- Handling different agent personalities (Teacher vs Crypto vs Medical).  
- Managing external API calls inside workflows.  
- Making sure the agents stayed helpful without “hallucinating” too much.

## Why This Was Exciting

This project gave me confidence in building **AI-powered real-world tools**.  
It also showed me how AI agents can work across **education, health, e-commerce, and automation**.  

The future looks exciting — I plan to extend this work by connecting these agents with **n8n workflows** and making them available as real apps people can use.

## Conclusion

Working with **OpenAI SDK + Gemini** taught me that AI agents aren’t just theoretical ideas — they can be practical helpers in daily life.  

This is just the beginning, and I look forward to building more advanced agents that combine **automation, personalization, and AI reasoning**. 🚀
