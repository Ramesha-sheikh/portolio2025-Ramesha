## Getting Started with n8n

Recently, I began learning about **workflow automation** and discovered **n8n**, a powerful open-source automation tool.  
It allows you to connect different services and create workflows without writing a lot of code.

What really caught my attention is how flexible and visual the tool is. You can drag-and-drop nodes, connect APIs, and
automate repetitive tasks in minutes.

## My First Workflow

For my first project, I tried something simple:

- Whenever a new row is added in **Google Sheets**,  
- n8n sends me an **email notification** automatically.  

It felt amazing to see automation work without me having to manually check the sheet.  

Later, I also experimented with connecting APIs and building multi-step workflows that would take hours to do manually.

## Challenges

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth. A few challenges I faced:

- Understanding how nodes pass data between each other  
- Setting up credentials securely  
- Debugging when workflows didn’t run as expected  

But with documentation and some trial and error, I was able to figure things out.

## Why n8n?

- It’s open-source and self-hostable  
- Supports hundreds of integrations (Google, Slack, Notion, APIs, etc.)  
- Great for quickly prototyping automation ideas  
- Saves time and reduces repetitive manual work

## Conclusion

Exploring **n8n** gave me a new perspective on automation.  
It’s not just for developers – anyone can use it to save time and build smarter workflows.

This was only my first step. In the future, I’m planning to explore more advanced workflows,
like connecting AI APIs with n8n to build intelligent automations. 🚀
